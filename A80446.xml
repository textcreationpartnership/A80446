            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>NOw concerning this oppreſſive <hi>Amalek</hi> which is here ſpoken of in the text, that doth thus oppreſs the people, and endevour to hinder their coming up to their reſt and ſalvation in the Lord Jeſus, let us conſider what and where he is; and if we truly examine our ſelves, we ſhall finde him to be within us, as well as without us, and we never come to have a true knowledge of him without us, till we have firſt had the knowledge of him within us; and thoſe that have him inwardly, do act with him outwardly; but he firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears within us, and there diſcovers himſelf what he is; for as the ſpirit of a man is paſſing out of <hi>Egypt</hi> as out of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and captivity, towards its reſt and center in the Lord Jeſus, we ſee the devil in us ſometimes let looſe for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon carrying our ſpirits,

<note place="margin">Whats meant by ſtumbling blocks.</note> and others go over, appears to be ſin, ſorrows, troubles, the fear of the Devil, death, hell, and damnation, together with all unjuſt Laws and Acts made by men contrary to the Law of God which is perfect Freedom;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.7.</note> all and whatſoever elſe that may appear to be laid in the way of a ſouls peace and freedom, are theſe ſtumbling blocks; and he that lays them is the devil, who is always <hi>ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi>

<note place="margin">Rev. 12.7, 8. Zech. 9.8.</note> the Lord of Hoſts, who is Captain General of all the forces that go forth in battel againſt Antichriſt the man of ſin, and all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies whatſoever that come up againſt the <hi>Iſrael</hi> and People of God.</p>

                  <hi>caſting up trenches about them to keep them in on every ſide,</hi> made Laws and Acts againſt them contrary to the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in them, to ſubject their perſons, ſpirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to the Laws, ways, forms, and limitations of men, as we may ſee in the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, how <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> acted againſt him to deſtroy him; for firſt of all as ſoon as <hi>Herod</hi> had heard that Chriſt was born, then he to deſtroy him,

               <p>And how did the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees, and all

               <p>The enemies of Chriſt which formerly ſate in Authority have made and kept up divers Laws and Acts of divers ſorts againſt the People to keep them in bondage and in ſubjection to themſelves and their Laws, when they ſhould be ſubject only to Chriſt and his Law whoſe Law is perfect Freedom;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.7.</note> and if any man act or ſpeak any thing contrary to ſuch a Law or Act made againſt ſuch things called blaſphemy by them, they preſently go to apprehend them as blaſphemers, accuſe and condemn them, ſeek their lives, baniſhment or impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Herod</hi> and others have done who get their living by

               <p>Thoſe then who may ſometime appear to have the power of the Nation in their hands, may appear to act like <hi>Saul,</hi> and to act like <hi>David,</hi> who came in the room of <hi>Saul;</hi> but I had rather they appeared to act as <hi>David,</hi> for he obeyed the voice of the Lord in all that he was commanded, and ſo enjoyed his Kingdom: and then if they ſo act, the power might the longer abide with them; but if they ſhould act like <hi>Saul,</hi> then they may expect to have the power taken from them by the Lord, as it was from <hi>Saul;</hi> for the Lord is juſt, and will revenge for his people.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:166672:7"/>
               <p>Now <hi>Saul</hi> obeyed not the voice of the Lord, which was that he ſhould utterly deſtroy the <hi>Amalekites</hi> and all that they had, but he did it not, <hi>but fled upon the ſpoil for himſelf, and ſo did evil in the ſight of the Lord,</hi>

               <p>And now what ſaith the Lord? Go, and ſmite <hi>Amalek,</hi> diſſolve him, take the power out of his hands, unbottom him of all his Laws and intereſts; <hi>Go, ſlay both man and woman, infant and ſuckling, ox and ſheep, camel and aſs.</hi>

               <p>ANd now <hi>David</hi> comes, takes the Kingdom, poſſeſſes it, and doth the work that God commanded, he ſmites the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and recovers all the ſpoil, the rights and priviledges of the people, which they had carried away, and reſtores it again into their hands, <hi>That there was nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them, neither ſmall nor great, neither ſons nor daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.18, 19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>goods nor any thing that they had taken away;</hi> David <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all, both of the flocks, herds, lands, goods and cattels, it all became</hi> Davids <hi>ſpoil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now it may pleaſe the Lord to put it into the hearts of thoſe who are to act for the Civil Right of the Nation, to act like <hi>David</hi> in this thing, to recover all that the People have loſt, and reſtore it again into their hands as <hi>David</hi> did, that none might complain of any want, or lie under any oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion any longer, neither ſay, One hath too much, and another too little of any kinde whatſoever; but that every one may have that which is convenient for him,
<note place="margin">Prov. 30.8, 9.</note> to his own ſatisfaction and content, which is the Kingdom of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And O what a pure, joyfull, peaceable Kingdom ſhould we then have,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6, 7.</note> when Chriſt ſhall thus take the Kingdom to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and raign in the place of man, as <hi>David</hi> did in the place of <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſo reſtore the people unto their rights again as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:166672:14"/>in the beginning, where all men ſhall have an equal propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſatisfaction, and where he that hath leaſt ſhall know no want, and he that hath much ſhall have nothing over, but every one ſhall enjoy himſelf in all things that himſelf hath, and doth poſſeſs in the Lord!</p>
               <p>This will be the Kingdom that Chriſt (<hi>Davids</hi> Lord) will take to himſelf, and for the People to eſtabliſh them in, and this will be a joyfull Kingdom, it will be the Lords King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>And now if the Lord will yet be pleaſed in and by this power to work righteouſneſs, do Juſtice, and to ſhew mercy, he is to recover us all our rights &amp; priviledges from the hands of our enemies who have detained it from us; he is to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all that ever we have loſt, and which thoſe that have been our Rulers have taken from us, and reſtore it again unto us, and not ſuffer them to go away with any thing but what is their own, and was before given them by the Lord, as to us; nothing of what was the Peoples (whoſe intereſt was as great as theirs in any thing that is the Lords) are they to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them, but to leave it behinde them, and the people again to poſſeſs and enjoy it as their own right and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>

<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.4, 5, 6.</note> yet the ſame ſpirit, life, and operating power which lived in others, acted it ſelf by them for that work being the ſame in all men; and they without that ſpirit, life and power, (all without God) could not do it; therefore it is meet that the ſame ſpirit and life in what form or body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, ſhould have the ſame freedom granted it as others in the ſame work with others.</p>
               <p>But now thoſe who do not rightly know God, that would be all themſelves, and have all to themſelves, and that do not <hi>love their neighbours as themſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 19.18.</note> will not agree that their neighbours (with them) ſhall have the ſame equal ſhare and proportion of the ſpoil which they have gained, that is their freedom and liberty, but will deny them of it, and ſay, it is ours, we have gained it, ſought for it, and will have it; but I ſay, this were ſtill but to ſet up (and act like) another Power of Fleſh, or more fleſhy then ever, alſo to marry another Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſo to beget more children which muſt alſo be ſlain with the reſt when ever they appear to be brought forth or ſet up.</p>

               <p>But now ſee <hi>Davids</hi> anſwer to theſe men of <hi>Belial</hi> that thus deſired the ſpoil, and would not yield to have it equally divided, <hi>Ye ſhall not do ſo</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>with that which the Lord hath given us, who hath preſerved us, and delivered the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that came againſt us into our hands;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And now this anſwer may our General (if the Lord ſhall pleaſe to put it into his heart) give to thoſe of any one party, faction, or opinion, that ſhould deſire to have all the power, rule and authority put into their hands, and they only to have the greateſt liberty and freedom to themſelves, as now ſome have done, and declared for in their Meetings of Preaching, Praying, &amp;c. No, <hi>You ſhall not do ſo my brethren with that which the Lord hath given us, who hath hitherto preſerved us, and delivered all that ever came againſt us, into our hands; for who will harken to you in this thing? but as his part is that acted</hi> with us in perſon, is of the Army, and doth deſire it; <hi>ſo ſhall his part be that acted</hi> not with us in perſon, is not of the Army, neither doth deſire it; they ſhall part alike, have their equal ſhare in true freedom and liberty; for hath the Lord been pleaſed to give the rights and freedoms of the People into our hands, for us with others to give it to them whoſe right it is as well as ours, and that deſerve as much of it in equity and reaſon as we do, and ſhall we withhold it from them? no, we will not, but they ſhall all have their equal ſhare in it to uſe at their own wils and pleaſures; every one ſhall have his freedom in things that are not hurtful to the Peace, Liberty and Freedom one of another; for it is theirs, and belongs to them as well as to us; and therefore who will harken to you in this thing that you ſhould keep it from them? ſurely none but ſuch as are of your own party, and that would maintain the ſame intereſt with you; and this anſwer being given, it would be as an anſwer from the Lord.</p>

               <p>But if there be a time wherein men or the enemies of Chriſt muſt yet raign with their Kingdom in oppoſition to the Lord and his Kingdom, let us be content with it, and patiently undergo the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of it; only let us tell them, that it is no continuing city for them wherein they ſhall abide or raign ever; for it is now even the laſt time, and the higher we ſee them to be advanced in themſelves, the nearer is the time of their diſſolution, or coming down; for a ſhort and a quick work will the Lord now make with all fleſh; and every one that is appointed to have his time, his turn, and his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, his beginning and his end, ſhall have it, which many we ſee have already had. And no party that now appears to be ſet up and indued with power below God ſhall ſtand long, no not long enough to ſettle or accompliſh any thing but their own ſhame,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.19. Pſal. 83.16, 17, 18. Heb. 12.27.</note> which ſhall befall all men that now go about to ſettle any thing when the Lord is ſhaking all things that may be ſhaken, <hi>that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain;</hi> and all things beſides himſelf are in a mutiny, a movable and unſetled condition, ſtill rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, like ſo many clouds from Eaſt to Weſt, or from one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to another, that it will ſettle no more till it ſettles and centers in the Lord, where it can move no more.</p>

               <p>And then ſhall we ſay,
<note place="margin">Luke 1.68. Iſai. 3.12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath viſited and redeemed his people</hi> from out of the hands of cruel men, <hi>Children that have been their oppreſſors, and women that have ruled over them and cauſed them to erre;</hi> and ſo brings all men forth of captivity and bondage, ignorance and darkneſs, out of all mutable, changeable and unſetled conditions that we have been in and under; and ſo leads captivity captive for us,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.8.</note> and gives gifts to us, which is perfect freedom, love, joy, peace, ſatisfaction and content in all things with the Lord Jeſus, which is the Kingdom of the Lord, and will be alſo our Kingdom when it is thus brought home to us, and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in us by the Lord.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it matters not much how variouſly ſoever we ſee men act in darkneſs, ſeeing it is not long before the Lord will appear to act all things himſelf in light, and we ſhall then appear to act all things with him in the ſame light, and ſo have joy, peace and comfort in all things with him: till the accompliſhment of which work,
<note place="margin">John. 15.1.</note> let every one patiently ſit down under his own Vine, the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> till the grapes be through ripe, and then wait upon the Lord for the bringing in of his own Kingdom, to reſtore to us the full fruition of thoſe graces of righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> peace, and joy in the holy Spirit, which is the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Thus I could not but declare my apprehenſions in theſe words at this time to you, as they are and were comprehended in me, and made known to me for you.</p>
